LAB 5, class Flight
"""

"""
Create the Flight class with the following elements:

- class attribute *departure_format* representing the expected format for 
  the departure date and time; its value should be "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"

- a constructor (__init__()) that receives two input parameters and uses them to initialise 
  *flight_num* (flight number) and *departure* (departure date and time) attributes; 
  it also initialises the *passengers* attribute (a list of objects of the Passenger class) 
  to an empty list

- get and set methods for the *departure* attribute (using appropriate decorators); 
  make this attribute private and assure that it is a datetime object that refers to 
  a moment in the future; if the input argument for the setter is string, it has to 
  be given in *departure_format*

- a method for adding a passenger to the *passengers* list; the method adds a new passenger 
  only if the input parameter is of the Passenger class, if the passenger is not already 
  in the list, and if he/she is covid safe

- a method that returns a string representation of the given Flight object (__str__())

- a method that returns the time left till departure as a tuple of the form (days, hours, mins)

- methods for turning the given Flight object into an iterator (__iter__(), __next__()) over the 
  flight passengers (that is, elements of the *passengers* list)
