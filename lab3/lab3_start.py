TASK 1:

Write a function that receives an integer value (n) and generates  
a dictionary with entries in the form x: S(x), 
where x is a number between 1 and n, and S(x) = 1 + 2 + ... + x.
The function also prints the dictionary in the decreasing value 
of the key, in the following way (for n=5):
5: 1+2+3+4+5=15
4: 1+2+3+4=10
3: 1+2+3=6
2: 1+2=3
1: 1=1

TASK 2:

Write a function that creates a dictionary from the two given lists, so that
elements of the 1st list are keys, while the corresponding elements of the 
2nd list are values. 
Print the dictionary sorted based on the element values.
(hint: use itemgetter() f. from the operator module)

Example: a list of countries and a list of the countries' national dishes
should be turned into a dictionary where keys are country names and values
are the corresponding dishes.

TASK 3:

Write a function that receives a string as its input parameter, and
calculates the number of digits, letters, and punctuation marks (.,!?;:)
in this string.
The function returns a dictionary with the computed values.

TASK 4:

Write a function that receives a list of web addresses (= website URLs) of various organisations.
Compute the number of addresses for each suffix (e.g., com, org, net) present in the list.
Create and return a dictionary of thus computed values (keys are website suffixes, values are
the corresponding counts)

# TASK 5:

Write a function that receives a piece of text and computes the frequency of tokens in the text 
(consider that a token is a string of contiguous characters between two spaces). 
Compute token frequency in case-insensitive manner.
Tokens and their frequencies should be stored in a dictionary (tokens as keys, frequencies as values). 
The function prints the resulting dictionary after sorting the tokens alphanumerically.

After testing the function, alter it so that:
- tokens are cleared of any excessive characters (e.g. spaces or punctuation marks)
before being added to the dictionary
- only tokens with at least 3 characters are added to the dictionary
- before being printed, the dictionary entries are sorted: 
    first, in the decreasing order of the tokens' frequencies, 
    and then in the increasing alphabetical order

TASK 6:

Write a function that accepts a sequence of comma separated passwords and
checks their validity using the following criteria:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z] => At least 1 lower case letter
2. At least 1 number between [0-9] => At least 1 digit
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z] => At least 1 upper case letter
4. At least 1 of these characters: $,#,@
5. Length in the 6-12 range (including 6 and 12)

TASK 7:

Write a function to count the total number of students per class. The function receives
a list of tuples of the form (<class>,<stud_count>). For example:
[('V', 1), ('VI', 1), ('V', 2), ('VI', 2), ('VI', 3), ('VII', 1)]

TASK 8:

Write a function that takes as its input a list of dictionaries with data about members of a sports team.
Each dictionary stores the following data about one team member: name, age, and competition score (0-100).
For example: {name:Bob, age:19, score:55.5} 
The function computes and prints the following statistics:
- the average (mean) age of the team members
- median, first and third quartile for the team's score
- name of the player with the highest score among those under 21 years of age
Finally, the function prints the members list sorted by the members' scores (from highest to lowest).

Hint: the 'statistics' module provides functions for the required statistics
